              My name is Dan and I help make custom automated equipment come to life. 
              In school I studied mechanical engineering and specialized in mechatronics 
              (a fancy word for robotics). I have built off my education throughout my career to 
              develop a specialized skillset focusing on all aspects of automated machines: 
              PLC programming, HMI design, I/O selection and troubleshooting, electrical cabinet 
              design, as well as validation and documentation. In my current role as an Automation 
              Engineer at Inari Medical, I work as an internal contractor for automated 
              equipment assisitng other departments with their automation needs. Through this I have 
              had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of custom machines utilizing motion control, 
              vision systems, custom graphics, presice control loops, and much more. If you think I could 
              be a good fit for a current or future automation project, you can reach out to me through 
              the contact form at the bottom of the page. Thank you for reading!

        <p class="project-description">
          This project was created in order to automate the bonding process of two plastic components which are 
          part of a high-volume subassembly (~65K/yr and counting). The average time an operator took to complete the task of applying glue, 
          pressing the parts together and curing the bond was around 1:30 - meaning it would take almost two full 
          shifts to complete a 300 unit work order. Our machine cut that time down drastically, allowing for a syringe 
          to be completed every 15 seconds. This allowed for the work order to get completed in only a few hours 
          instead of two days - <b>A 250% improvement.</b> This machine has been running issue-free in the cleanroom for 
          the past 3-4 months and has made over 15k components (as of 10/23).

          This project was completed by my co-worker and I. 
          He was in charge of the mechanical side of things and I did everything controls related. This included 
          selecting sensors and a system which would suit our needs, along with all of the programming and human 
          machine interface (HMI) work. This was the first project where I really got to dive into the design side 
          of the user interface and learn how to make a beautifiul and modern looking interface that people want to 
          use rather than the clunky and dated interfaces which are still so common on nearly all manufacturing 
          equipment.

        <p class="project-description">
          Pictured above is the main operator screen for the machine. I tried to keep the interface as simple as 
          possible so it would be intuitive to use, while also providing enough useful information. All the operator 
          needed to do was press the "ON" button and the machine would do the rest, counting passed/failed units and 
          alerting for any errors and prompting the user if needed as seen in the image of an example error screen 
          below.

          Handling the errors on this machine proved to be a bit of a challenge. There were many special scenarios which 
          were dependent on timing and syringe locations, amoung other variables. For each error, this error screen 
          would be populated with a unique error message and tasks to complete before allowing the user to restart the 
          machine.

        <p class="project-subtitle">[ 2021 | Cost: $10k ]</p>
        <p class="project-description">
          The project for this fixture was given to me as a way to check if our vertical braiding machines 
          were calibrated at the beginning of a work order. This was originally planned because of issues 
          with braids being out of spec for whole lots due to improper machine calibration. Unfortunately 
          after I had validated and released this piece of equipment it was de-prioritized due to lack of 
          space and then canceled because better machine maintenance had seemed to be solving the issue and 
          the camera system could be better utilized elsewhere. Although it was hard to see my work be 
          sidelined, it made sense to not implement an unnessary step to the manufacturing process. I also 
          learned a lot about vision systems and lighting, and since it is not released I can share more of 
          this project than I otherwise would be able to.

          The operation of this fixture was very simple: he mandrel would be placed in the locating fixture, 
          and the camera would automatically verify if the pick angle of the braid was in spec and relay a 
          "pass" or "fail" to the user.

          For this project I used a Cognex In-Sight 8000 series camera with In-Sight explorer to configure 
          the software. The fixture also had a screen where the user could monitor the output of the camera. 
          The screen also displayed the value of the 3 angles being measured and the average which the result 
          of the test was based on.

        <p class="project-description">
          This was one of my first projects after starting at Inari. I worked with a senior engineer in charge 
          of developing nitenol processing capabilities in house, and helped build a system for electropolishing 
          (a chemical process for removing sharp edges). He directed me on what he needed the system to do and I 
          created a control system and user interface to allow him to carry on with his process development. The 
          main functions of the system were to allow the user to create a voltage profile which would be applied 
          to the component through the control of a power supply. The system was also to monitor acid temp and 
          store data for later review. The voltage and amperage data were also plotted vs time to give the user a 
          visual representation that could be reviewed - this could be seen on the "Scanning" tab. 
          <br><br>
          Since this was very early on, I had not established a standard for controllers yet. Since this 
          application required large amounts of fast and presice data collection, we decided to go with a NI 
          CompactDAQ.
        </p>

        <p class="project-subtitle">Image of NI CompactDAQ from NI website</p>
        <p class="project-description">
          Since this was a relatively simple project in terms of the I/O needed, we decided to go witha 4-slot 
          chassis. For this machine we needed to use a 0-10v output to control the voltage and amperage limit 
          of the power supply, monitor the voltage/amperage using a 0-10v input, and monitor acid temp with a 
          thermocouple. 
          <br><br>
          After selecting the controller, the next challenge was figuring out how to use the graphical 
          programming interface of LabVIEW. 
        </p>

        <p class="project-subtitle">Screenshot of LabVIEW program</p>
        <p class="project-description">
          This image shows one small chunk of the code which I wrote for this system. It took some time to get 
          used to the style of graphical programming but by the end I felt comfortable with it and was creating 
          my own function blocks to keep everything organized. My overall impression of the LabVIEW environment 
          was that it was great for data collection and creating applications with simple interfaces, but the 
          graphical style of programming can get out of hand pretty quickly. I probably spent just as much time 
          organizing everything to make it readable as I did with the actual programming. 
        </p>

        <p class="project-subtitle">Screenshot of user interface</p>
        <p class="project-description">
          Lastly, this is the image of the user interface for the machine. Here the user can set up their 
          desired parameters and monitor machine function. The program also records and stores all voltage, 
          current, and acid temp data for each run for later review if necessary. There is also a "Scanning" 
          tab which displays a graph of voltage and curernt vs time to be used for analysis as well. 
          <br><br>
          Overall this was a very successful project, saving us at least $50k on machine costs while also 
          keeping the technology in-house to be able to add new features as needed. This setup was key for 
          determining the ideal parameters for the EP process.

        <p class="project-description">
          This system was created to aid in increasing nitenol processing capabilities. Initially we looked into buying a 
          pre-built solution but found that there weren't a lot of companies that sold salt bath machines for our scale and 
          the quotes we were getting on the compatable systems were north of $200k with long lead times. Because of these 
          reasons we decided it would be best if we built the system ourselves instead. 
          <br><br> 
          I led this project with a 
          team of about 5 other engineers and technicians, all contributing to the successful completion of this machine. My 
          role was the controller programming, human-machine interface (HMI), electrical panel and wiring, and overseeing the 
          completion of other tasks taken on by other individuals.

        <img class="proj-content-img" src="src/images/project-images/salt-bath/SB_MainScreen.png" alt="">
        <p class="project-subtitle">Main HMI screen</p>
        <p class="project-description">
          The image above shows the main screen of the HMI where the control and monitoring of the machine takes palce. The 
          right edge of the screen shows the navigation tab where the user can go to the recipe screen, lock the doors, or 
          turn on the "party lights" which activate the LED strip to pulse purple and orange (Inari colors) when the machine 
          is idle. The bottom buttons allow the user to control the x-y gantry which carries a basket for components to be 
          heat set. In the top right of the screen the user can select a recipe to use and the active recipe will be displayed.
          Also on the left side is all the relevant machine data and statuses taken into account before allowing a part to be 
          heat set. In the middle of the screen there are also controls for the quenching tank as well as statuses for the 
          state of both the salt and the quench water.

        <p class="project-description">
          Next is the recipe screen. This screen allows the user to add, edit, and delete recipes. When adding or editing 
          recipes, the appropriate keyboard is displayed for category of data: ex. when entering a name the full keypad is 
          available, though when entering a number only the keypad is shown. All recipes on this page are processed though 
          a recipe function block I created for this application and have been able to reuse for future projects.

        <p class="project-subtitle">Electrical Cabinet</p>
        <p class="project-description">
          Pictured above is the electrical cabinet for the salt bath. The bottom row handles incoming power and everything 
          needing a 120v source including a relay for controlling power to the salt furnace, a solid state relay for 
          controlling the heater for the quenching water, and power supplies for the controller, inputs/outputs (I/O), and 
          motors. The middle row handles 24v power distribition and signals from I/O, as well as a regen clamp for the 
          motors on the far right. The top row shows the Beckhoff CX-5120 outfitted with several digital I/O terminal, a 
          4-20ma input terminal for a temperature sensor, and a terminal for controlling an LED strip (EL2564). I learned 
          on this project that wires on Beckhoff controllers should only be landed from below to avoid obstructing the 
          status LEDs of the terminals which I was guilty of doing this time around. Next to the controller are relays 
          controlling the pump and valves for the quench tank, a thermocouple to 4-20ma converter, and a DC-DC converter 
          for the LED strip. Congrats if you made it through this ramble.
